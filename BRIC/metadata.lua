	'description', "BRIC is an acronym coined in 2001 referring to the countries of Brazil, Russia, India, and China deemed to be developing countries at a similar stage of newly advanced economic development. This mods adds a sponsor that combines some of the perks, drawbacks, unique buildings and vehicles of those 4 mission sponsors into one, to create one medium difficulty/balanced sponsor.\nThe rockets have a Chinese/Russian design, which allows them to carry 10 more passengers thanks to the compact passenger module, but they also take twice as long to travel to and from mars. You also have access to the Brazilian large supply pods (though you don’t start with any free).\nThe other unique vehicle you have is the Russian RC Driller. The unique building is the advanced waste rock processor, which converts waste rock into metals, rare metals and concrete. It’s not as overpowered as the Brazilian Rare Metal Refinery, but you get some construction materials at the same time as a conciliation.\nAs with India you start with the Low-G Engineering tech, allowing you to build medium domes from the start. Domes and interior buildings also costs 20% less in metals and concrete. Applicants generate 25% faster, which should help you fill up those larger rockets and domes. Finally you get the Russian perks of half price fuel refinery prefabs and start with the Fueled Extractors tech.\nStarting funds, sponsor research, rare metals price, and applicant pool size are around the average of the four sponsors. Most of the sponsor goals (and the default icon and other cosmetic things) are from Russia, but there’s a couple of new ones there too.\nIn the future I might make some more changes to balance the sponsor, and add a new icon.",
