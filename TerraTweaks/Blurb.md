Mod Features

**Higher/Fully Customisable terraforming thresholds**

Dust storms and cold waves end at 66% of atmosphere and temperature respectively, rather than 50%, and toxic rains start at 10% atmosphere and end at 70%. These thresholds and most others are customisable via the mod options, so you can actually set them to whatever you want.

**Vegetation matters for atmosphere**

Atmosphere loss is increased when atmosphere is higher than vegetation (up to 2% when atmosphere is 100% and vegetation 0%) and Carbonate Processor effectiveness is also reduced (up to -50%)

**Fewer seeds are harvested from bushes/trees/cover crops**

Each of these produce roughly half as many seeds per harvest (-50% applied after soil quality boost). Bushes and trees have longer between seed harvests (it’s based on their original growth time, instead of once per day once fully grown). You will actually have to spread vegetation across the map if you want enough seeds.

**Terraforming buildings cost and consume more**

Carbonate processors consume 7.5x as much waste rock (30 per 0.4% atmosphere increase)

GHG factories consume 12x as much fuel (6 fuel per 0.25% temp increase), they also require maintenance more often, and reduce effectiveness more at higher temperatures (effectiveness drops 0.05% per 1% temp increase as temp approaches 25%, an extra 0.01% for every 10% temp increases past that, down to 0.01% minimum)

Other cost/maintenance changes detailed below

**Terraforming special projects cost more**

Terraforming special projects cost more the more they are repeated, seed vegetation especially. Full breakdown below

**Better forestation plants and seed vegetation mission**

Forestation plants can contribute 40% to vegetation overall (i.e. they ignore the contribution seed vegetation has made) and can get the amplify upgrade. Seed vegetation missions cause local vegetation blooms (they’re small but noticeable after you’ve done enough missions). When your rocket returns from a seed vegetation mission, a new one spawns if none are currently available (so you can always have at least 1 rocket continuously doing seed vegetation missions)

**Disasters impact terraforming**

Cold waves cause a small drop in temperature, and GHG factories are less effective during them. Carbonate processors shut down during dust storms.

**More applicants appear when terraforming thresholds are reached**

Application pool is increased by 10 when you get liquid water, when you have your first (pure) rain, and when the atmosphere becomes breathable.

**(Optional) Capture Ice Asteroids can cause cold wave**

The chance of this happening varies depending on the temperature parameter, is reduced for the first 5 times the mission is repeated, and is adjustable in the mod options (set chances to zero to turn this off)

**(Optional) Terraforming parameters impact soil quality**

Soil quality drops when terraforming parameters are low, plus you can get random short lived toxic rain without warning. This can cause soil quality to go negative, but you can still plant lichen.

**(Optional) Open farms are nerfed**

Open farms plant crops more slowly, and open farm crops can die due to disasters, the farm not working, poor soil quality, or crops not being harvested quickly enough.

**Building cost/maintenance changes**

Core heat convector electricity consumption increased 50->80  
Core heat convector costs 120 metals (+20) and 80 polymers (+30)  
Core heat convector maintenance amount increased from 2 to 3

Carbonate processor costs 100 metals (+50) and 80 machine parts (+30)  
Carbonate processor maintenance amount increased from 2 to 5

Open farm electricity consumption increased to 5 and maintenance resource switched to Machine Parts

**Terraforming special projects cost changes**

Seed vegetation: +100 more seeds the first 2 repeats, 60 more seeds until the 12th repeat, 50 more seeds each time after that

Import Greenhouse Gases: +£60M each time it's repeated

Capture Ice Asteroids: machine parts cost increased to 16,18,20,22,25 for first repeats then +5 each time after

Cloud seeding: costs +5 more polymers plus 5 more each time it's repeated

Launch space mirror: costs +50 metal and +10 electronics

All special projects: cost more fuel each repeat
